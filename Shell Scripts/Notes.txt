Have made changes in the LDAPSync.sh file. Replaced the ldif file with a new one. Now the same needs to verified whether the ldif file "testdomain1-DSmailUsers-template.ldif" is physically present in QASIB2. In QASIB1 it is present.


BuildCopy2QASIB--> once the 9.3 branched out i need to make changes in the shell scripts to search for 9.3 latest builds. As of now it looks for 9.2 latest builds

RestoreDB.sql--> Need to make changes in the RestoreDb sql file to provide the path of the required database that needs to be restored.

Shell script to copy build will be executed from 'prashantm@KAHUNA:/avin/avin_shellscripts/' directory so any changes to the shell scripts should be copied in unix format to the specified location.
